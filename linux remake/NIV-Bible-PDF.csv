Genesis,1,2,"God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness."
Genesis,1,3,"God called the light ""day,"" and the darkness he called ""night."" And there was evening, and there was morning-"
Genesis,1,4,"And God said, ""Let there be an expanse between the waters to separate water from water."""

Genesis,1,7,"And God said, ""Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear."" And it was so."
Genesis,1,8,"God called the dry ground ""land,"" and the gathered waters he called ""seas."""
Genesis,1,9,And God saw that it was good.
Genesis,1,10,"Then God said, ""Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds."" And it was so.

Genesis,1,11,"And there was evening, and there was morning-the third day."
Genesis,1,12,"And God said, ""Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark seasons and days and and let them be lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth."" And"

Genesis,1,16,"And God said, ""Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of"
Genesis,1,17,"So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living and moving thing with which the water teems, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And"
Genesis,1,18,God saw that it was good.
Genesis,1,19,"God blessed them and said, ""Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth."""
Genesis,1,20,"And there was evening, and there was morning-the fifth day."
Genesis,1,21,"And God said, ""Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, creatures that move along the ground, and wild animals, each according to its kind."" And it was so."
Genesis,1,22,"God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was"
Genesis,1,23,"Then God said, ""Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground."""

Genesis,1,26,"Then God said, ""I give you every seed- bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food."
Genesis,1,27,"And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air and all the creatures that move on the ground- everything that has the breath of life in it-I give every green plant for food."" And"
Genesis,1,28,"God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning-the sixth day."
Genesis,2,1,Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array.
Genesis,2,2,By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work.
Genesis,2,3,"And God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had"

Genesis,2,7,"Now the Lord God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there he put the man he had formed."
Genesis,2,8,And the Lord God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground-trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were knowledge of good and evil.
Genesis,2,9,A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was separated into four headwaters.

Genesis,2,18,"The Lord God said, ""It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper"
Genesis,2,19,"Now the Lord God had formed out of the ground all the beasts of the field and all the birds of the air. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name."
Genesis,2,20,"So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds of the air and all the beasts of the field. But for Adam no suitable helper was found."
Genesis,2,21,"So the Lord God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man's ribs and closed up the place with flesh."
Genesis,2,22,"Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man."
Genesis,2,23,"The man said, ""This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called 'woman, ' for she was taken"
Genesis,2,24,"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh."
Genesis,2,25,"The man and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame."
Genesis,3,1,Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the Lord
Genesis,3,2,"God had made. He said to the woman, ""Did God really say, 'You must not eat from any tree in the garden'?"""
Genesis,3,3,"The woman said to the serpent, ""We may eat fruit from the trees in the but God did say, 'You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or ""You will not surely die,"" the serpent ""For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."""

She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it. opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for"
Genesis,3,5,"Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the Lord God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from the Lord God among the trees of the garden."
Genesis,3,6,"But the Lord God called to the man,"
Genesis,3,7,"He answered, ""I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was"
Genesis,3,8,"And he said, ""Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat"
Genesis,3,9,"The man said, ""The woman you put here with me-she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it."""
Genesis,3,10,"Then the Lord God said to the woman, ""What is this you have done?"" The woman said, ""The serpent deceived me,"
Genesis,3,11,"So the Lord God said to the serpent, ""Because you have done this, ""Cursed are you above all the livestock and all the wild animals! You will crawl on your belly and you will eat dust all the days of"
Genesis,3,12,"And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel."""
Genesis,3,13,"To the woman he said, ""I will greatly increase your pains in childbearing; with pain you will give birth to children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you."""
Genesis,3,14,"To Adam he said, ""Because you listened to your wife and ate from the tree about which I commanded you, 'You must not eat of it,' ""Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful"

Genesis,3,16,"By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground, since from it you were taken; for dust you are and to dust you will return."""

Genesis,3,18,The Lord God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them.
Genesis,3,19,"And the Lord God said, ""The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever."""
Genesis,3,20,So the Lord God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken.
Genesis,3,21,"After he drove the man out, he placed cherubim and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the"

Genesis,4,8,"Then the Lord said to Cain, ""Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast?"
Genesis,4,9,"If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must"
Genesis,4,10,"Now Cain said to his brother Abel, ""Let's go out to the field."" And while they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him."
Genesis,4,11,"Then the Lord said to Cain, ""Where is your brother Abel?"" ""I don't know,"" he replied. ""Am I my brother's keeper?"""
Genesis,4,12,"The Lord said, ""What have you done?"

Genesis,4,18,"But the Lord said to him, ""Not so ; if anyone kills Cain, he will suffer vengeance seven times over."" Then the"
Genesis,4,19,Lord put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him.
Genesis,4,20,"So Cain went out from the Lord 's presence and lived in the land of Nod,"
